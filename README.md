# Biosense - Web
IoT system for indoor plant care, monitoring health and offering personalized recommendations for growth.

## Our Inspiration 💡  
---
The same way a Fitbit monitors a variety of human health metrics including temperature and oxygen saturation, we have developed the same for plants. Our team noticed that there were a lack of applications which did so, and thus sought to make one. Knowing this, paired with UN SDG’s, we created Biosense. 

For the aim of  "Good Health and Well-being" we want indoor plants to enhance air quality and overall well-being. We embraced "Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure," through employing plant vital monitoring systems, advancing smart agriculture and sustainability. By addressing "Responsible Consumption and Production," indoor gardening promotes water and energy efficiency, incombating climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. This synergistic approach fosters a sustainable and healthier future for both ourselves and the plants.

Our system combines the internet of things (IoT) which senses the environment to detect the health of plants, all whilst identifying any diseases it may carry. We are using PostgreSQL IoT which monitors luminosity, temperature, humidity and soil temperature. Once a disease is identified, the system gives personalised recommendations for better health and growth.
